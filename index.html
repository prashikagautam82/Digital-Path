            <h2> 31st of July</h2>
            <p>Hi, so today was my first day here at Phorest. I was really nervous. After I came I met my mentor Aoife, she told met what we are going to do for rest of the day. She helped me set up the laptop(basically everything was done her by I was just watching her do). Then she told me everything about Phorest basically what Phorest is, what it does and everything. I was just shocked to know that it was started 20 years ago. It is literally older than meðŸ˜„. It not just work with salons here in Ireland but around the world. During the lunch time while eating our food we watched the product lunch live. The food was good :). After the lunch time I went with Lauren and she told me everything about support. There are 3 levels and they deal with clients when they have any issues. Overall the day was good<3.</p>

We did that till the lunch time and we ate dumplings and noodles during lunch time. After that I learned about data from Cormac, it was interesting. He told about data from a presentation and I was so shocked when he told that the presentation was made by an AI. I thought it was made by him but actually it was not. He just typed a line about what he wanted and everything was there within few seconds it was so cool.  </p>
